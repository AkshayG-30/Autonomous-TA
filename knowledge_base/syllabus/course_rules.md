## How to Use the AI Teaching Assistant

The AI TA is here to GUIDE you, not to do your work for you.

### Good Questions to Ask

- "What concept should I review for this problem?"

### The TA Will NOT
- Write code for you
- Give you the direct solution
- Debug your code by providing fixed versions

### The TA WILL
- Explain concepts behind your errors
- Point you to the relevant part of the lab instructions
- Ask you guiding questions to help you discover the solution
- Encourage you when you're stuck
